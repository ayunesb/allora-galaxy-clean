# Error Handling Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure comprehensive error handling is implemented throughout the application.

## UI Components

- [ ] All form fields have appropriate error states
- [ ] Form submissions include proper validation with clear error messages
- [ ] Data fetching components handle loading, error, and empty states
- [ ] Empty states have appropriate messaging and actions
- [ ] Error boundaries are properly configured at page and component levels
- [ ] All error states offer next steps or recovery options where possible
- [ ] Partial failure states are handled gracefully

## API & Data Layer

- [ ] Edge functions validate inputs before processing
- [ ] Edge functions return standardized error responses
- [ ] All database operations have error handling
- [ ] API error responses include request ID for tracking
- [ ] Network errors are handled appropriately
- [ ] Authentication failures redirect to login with appropriate messaging

## Retry & Resilience

- [ ] Critical operations implement retry with exponential backoff
- [ ] Users are informed about retries in progress
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern is implemented for external services
- [ ] Cache fallbacks are used where appropriate
- [ ] Stale data is shown during refetching

## Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] All errors are logged to system_logs table with context
- [ ] Client-side errors include component stack traces
- [ ] Severe errors trigger immediate alerts
- [ ] Error logs include tenant and user context
- [ ] Error frequency is monitored with alerting thresholds

## User Experience

- [ ] Error messages are concise and actionable
- [ ] Technical details are hidden unless explicitly requested
- [ ] Error states match the application's design language
- [ ] Global errors don't block the entire application
- [ ] Toast notifications are used appropriately for transient errors

## Development & Testing

- [ ] Error scenarios are included in component tests
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty data, null values, etc.)
- [ ] Network failures are simulated and handled in tests
- [ ] Error boundaries catch rendering errors
- [ ] Console is free of unhandled errors and warnings

## Final Review Checks

- [ ] Error messages and UIs are consistent across the application
- [ ] All code paths that can fail have error handling
- [ ] User workflows can recover from interruptions
- [ ] Critical paths have fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Error documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Setup monitoring alerts for error thresholds

## Launch Readiness

- [ ] Error monitoring dashboard is configured
- [ ] Alert thresholds are set appropriately
- [ ] On-call rotation is established
- [ ] Incident response plan is documented
- [ ] Error reporting to external systems is configured (if applicable)

## Post-Launch Monitoring

- [ ] Monitor error rates after deployment
- [ ] Track most common error types
- [ ] Identify patterns in error occurrences
- [ ] Measure impact on user experience
- [ ] Update error handling based on real-world data
